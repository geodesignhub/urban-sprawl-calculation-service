'''
The "processAlgorithm" method is a part of the QGIS Processing Framework 
and it is used to perform some action for processing a raster and a vector layer.
'''

def processAlgorithm():
	'''
	1.Get the path of the input raster layer and output path.
	2.Copy the input vector layer and add it to the QGIS project.
	3.Check and add the necessary fields to the vector layer, such as "Dis" and "settlement_area".
	4.Get the Spatial Index library using the get_si_lib() method.
	5.Open the input raster layer using GDAL and get its pixel size.
	6.Get all the features of the vector layer.
	7.Start a loop through all the features.
	8.Use the get_si_raster() method to get the clipped raster, result matrix, and clipped matrix for each feature.
	9.Save the clipped raster for each feature using the save_raster() method.
	10.Calculate and save the DIS for each feature using the calculate_and_save_dis() method.
	11.Calculate and save the WDIC for each feature using the calculate_and_save_wdis() method.
	12.Use the calculate() method to calculate the build-up area and settlement area for each feature.
	13.Write the vector layer to the output path in GPKG format.
	14.Set the progress of the processing feedback and return the output path.
